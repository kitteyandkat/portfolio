I am currently enrolled at Nebula Academy, and I am working on foundational skills with Javascript, React, HTML and CSS. I graduated from Hawai'i Pacific University in 2020, with a Bachelors in Science in Biology, with a concentration in Human Health Sciences. I hope to integrate my passions for both Computer and Human Health Sciences, by developing software that innovate both fields.</p> </div>
