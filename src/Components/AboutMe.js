export default () => <div><p class='welcome'>Welcome!</p><p class='about-text'>My name is Sarah Johnson and I am a freelance software engineer. I am a graduate of Nebula Academy, where I learned foundational skills in Javascript, React, HTML, CSS, Deployment and PostgreSQL. Additionally, I graduated from Hawai'i Pacific University in 2020 and obtained a Bachelors in Science in Biology, with a concentration in Human Health Sciences. I hope to integrate my passions for both Human Health and Computer Sciences, by developing software that innovate both fields. Below are some examples of my work.
